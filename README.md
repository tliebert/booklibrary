# booklibrary

This is a project on The Odin Project's fullstack JS track. It is designed to get familiar with object constructors. 

## Object constructors / DOM rendering. 

DOM fetching / rendering methods are attached as prototype functions to the main Book constructor. This is not ideal as it mixes the rendering and the logic of the library, but was useful in exploring how methods are added to the prototype. 

## CSS

I wanted to explore creating an overlay, so the Add Book button displays an overlay menu that slides in from the left. I also created a custom checkbox and delved deeper into the default Chrome stylesheet, specifically as it relates to the default behavior for input elements.
